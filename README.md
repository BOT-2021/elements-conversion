## Here We Will Be Learning About Basic Function's Of Python

# Step 1] What is Python?

  Ans - Python is a highlevel programming language , hence which is also known as Object Oriented Language . It is the most easiest language   to learn . It uses simple - basic syntaxe's which we will learn here .  [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_programming_language) 

# Step 2] Why Should I learn Python First? Why not to try some other Languages first like C/C++ ?

  Ans - Hmmm , It's a good question. So basically as You know Python is a very asy language as it uses Intrepreter to run the code . For       Example if you put a code ->  
  
                                a=10
                                b=20
                                print(a+b)
                                
                Hence Output -> 30
                
         But if you put C or D -> The code will not execute and hence it will show ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
                              <ipython-input-2-3984b433e022> in <module>
                                1 a=10
                                2 b=20
                          ----> 3 print(a+b+c)

                         NameError: name 'c' is not defined
                         
This is why you should learn Python first , by using simple human language you can easily understand the concept of the language , Where as the language C / C++ contain's Compiler in which a Programmer must have to enter whole code correctly or else the whole programm will not run until and unless it is programmed again with correct statement's and logic . 

Example if you put code ---> 
                                 
                                 
                                 #include <stdio.h>    
                        int main()
                    { 
                      // Displays the string inside quotations
                          printf("C Programming");
                           return 0;
                        }
                        
                The Output ---> C programming 
                
                
                          But if you code it worngly then ---->  gcc /tmp/BKVH65M3PR.c -lm
                                                 /tmp/BKVH65M3PR.c: In function 'main':
                                /tmp/BKVH65M3PR.c:6:5: error: expected declaration or statement at end of input
                                    6 |     return 0;
                                      |     ^~~~~~
                                      
                 why error? becuase you forgot } in the end of the program   
                 
So this is why you should learn Python first . These code are taken from [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)
